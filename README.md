Career Development - IT Support
<br/>
Welcome to Career Development! Over the next 15 weeks, we will work together to help you build a solid and effective job search strategy. The key word is STRATEGY. We will research the industry, learn how to tailor our resumes and cover letters to specific jobs, articulate the technical skills you've learned and maneuver the most difficult interview questions.
<br/>
We have a lot of work to do! But before we jump in, please familiarize yourself with the syllabus below. It is a roadmap for our time together and while there will be a few surprises along the way, the overall schedule will help you use your time efficiently.
