# Career Development Curriculum  

Career Development - IT Support  

Welcome to Career Development! Over the next 15 weeks, we will work together to help you build a solid and effective job search strategy. The key word is STRATEGY. We will research the industry, learn how to tailor resumes and cover letters to specific jobs, articulate the technical skills you've learned and maneuver the most difficult interview questions.  

We have a lot of work to do! But before we jump in, please familiarize yourself with the syllabus below. It is a roadmap for our time together and while there will be a few surprises along the way, the overall schedule will help you use your time efficiently. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.

## ACCOUNTS
Please sign up for the following accounts by Week 1:  

<b><a href="https://mail.google.com">GMAIL</a></b>  
You must have a professional Gmail account (first name, last name, maybe a number). We rely <b>HEAVILY</b> on Google Calendar, Forms and other G-Suite apps to communicate with you.  
  

<b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LINKEDIN</a></b>  
LinkedIn is a professional networking tool that allows us to create profiles, search for jobs and connect with other professionals in our industry. We will have a session dedicated to creating LinkedIn profiles, but it helps to already have an account before we begin.  
  
  
<b><a href="http://creddle.io/">CREDDLE</a></b>  
After we've drafted, edited and re-written our resumes, we will use Creddle's clean, professional templates to make them look good!  
  
  
<b><a href="https://slack.com">SLACK</a></b>  
Slack is an excellent way to communicate with your fellow classmates after class. I've created a room for your class and will send details via email.  
  
  
<b><a href="https://www.meetup.com/">MEETUP</a></b>  
MeetUp lists events, workshops and other gatherings by interest. This is a great place to find events where we can practice our networking skills and connect with others in tech.
